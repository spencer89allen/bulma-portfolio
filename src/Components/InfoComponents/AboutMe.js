                                <p>A lifelong learner, a lover of complex problems, a passion for creative solutions, and crazy about code. I'm the type of person who thrives in a fast-paced environment and is always eager to tackle obstacles head on. My work experiences rang from many things: from coal mining to tech support. From engineering research to real estate brockering. I landed on codeing because of my love for solving puzzels and building things.</p>
